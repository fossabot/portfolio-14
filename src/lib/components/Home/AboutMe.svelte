				I've studied and worked as a full-stack developer for years but never found the satisfaction
				I needed until I discovered the art UI/UX Design in 2022. My current focus is UX design -
				providing the best user experience through research, problem-solving, flows, and wireframes.

				I don't chase "silver bullets" because they don't exist. Every project is unique and always
				riddled with ambiguity and constraints. Fortunately, there's no need to reinvent the wheel,
				I can follow industry guidelines and proven UX frameworks â€” beginning with a discovery phase
				to understand the problem; followed by prototyping, validating my ideas with users, and
				collaborating with stakeholders throughout the process. Taking these simple steps has never
				failed me and always leads to innovative solutions and successful outcomes.
