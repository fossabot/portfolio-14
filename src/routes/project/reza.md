## Overview

## Problem statement

The reason I chose this problem for my team

## Users & Audience

## Roles & Responsibilities

## Scope & Constraints

We were given 2 weeks to finish our project so I decided that we should use our limited time properly and focus only on 3 most important features: Searching, Detail, Booking

I set up a meeting time for my team at 7:00 PM every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to both avoid clashing with our classes time and make sure everyone is not at their school/company.

We use Discord for our daily meeting and share our progress through screen share
