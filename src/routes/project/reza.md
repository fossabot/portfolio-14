## Overview

Imagine you need to quickly organize a party for your group of friends. You are not a cuisine expert or know all the cool places in the city. You opened Google and search for the nearest restaurants but then you realized you don't know much about its foods, price or how to contact them to reserve a table.

We're living in the modern era, you're not going to look for their phone numbers and call them, are you?

You need a mobile app that can:

♦ Recommend the most trendy restaurants

♦ Show you its menu, price and past reviews,

♦ Let you reserve a table when it's available and then remind you when it's time and guide you there.

## Problem statement

The reason I chose this problem for my team

## Users & Audience

## Roles & Responsibilities

I volunteered to be the team leader because I had more free time than my peers and my time management skill is decent.

At every steps in our process I gave each members a task and a deadline. Obviously I don't expect them to finish on time since they have school/work but it's still important to estimate so that I can minimize the risk in the future.

## Scope & Constraints

We were given <strong>2 weeks</strong> to finish our project so I decided that we should use our limited time properly and focus only on 3 most important features: Searching, Detail, Booking

I set up a meeting time for my team at 7:00 PM every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to both avoid clashing with our classes time and making sure everyone is at home and relaxed.

We use Discord for our daily meeting and share our progress and feedback through screen share.
