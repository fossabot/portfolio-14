## Overview

Imagine you need to quickly organize a party for your group of friends. You are not a cuisine expert or know all the cool places in the city. You opened Google and search for the nearest restaurants but then you realized you don't know much about its foods, price or how to contact them to reserve a table.

We're living in the modern era, you're not going to look for their phone numbers and call them, are you?

You need a mobile app that can:

<strong>

♦ Recommend the most trendy restaurants

♦ Show you its menu, price and past reviews,

♦ Let you reserve a table when it's available and then remind you when it's time and guide you there.

</strong>

## Problem statement

We were frustrated because table reservation apps are not as popular as food ordering apps in Vietnam. People still rely on the old ways of booking a table by phone and miss out on discounts.

We look at one of our competitor apps [PasGo](https://pasgo.vn) and relized some important features are missing:

<strong>

♦ Cancel a table

♦ Find direction

♦ Let you reserve a table when it's available and then remind you when it's time and guide you there.

</strong>


## Users & Audience

## Roles & Responsibilities

I volunteered to be the team leader because I had more free time than my peers and I'm quite confident in my time management skill.

At every steps in our process I gave each members a task and a deadline. Obviously I don't expect them to finish on time since they have school/work but it's still important to estimate so that **I can minimize the potential risk in the future**.

## Scope & Constraints

We were given **2 weeks** to finish our project so I decided that we should use our limited time properly and focus only on 3 most important features: Searching, Detail, Booking

I set up a meeting time for my team at 7:00 PM every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to both avoid clashing with our classes time and making sure everyone is at home and relaxed.

We use Discord for our daily meeting and share our progress and feedback through screen share.
