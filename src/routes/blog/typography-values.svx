## Make typography accessible

## Light or Dark Background?

A large majority of websites favored dark on light color schemes. People use a less aggressive contrast of an off-white or even beige background with dark-gray text. The off-white is often chosen to lower contrast. If you're making a news/blog website, you might want a comfortable lengthy reading experience.

Black text on a white background is a common pattern for body copy. The contrast is easy on the eyes and is, at least among these websites, the status quo.

## font-size for heading

<Image src="{headingFontSizes}" alt="heading font sizes" />

The most popular font size for headlines is **between 29 and 32 px**.

```
headline font size = body copy font size * 2.4
```

## font-size for body

The most popular font size for body copy is **between 14 and 16 px**.

## line-height

For Heading: 110% -> 130%
For Body: 130% - 150%

## letter-spacing

Headings with crispness use negative letter-spacing. (usually -0.5%, -1%, -2%)

There's no **correct** way to achieve perfect spacing atm.

## line-length / text-width

https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability

The optimal line length for body text is **50-75 characters**

On Desktop: 600px is a very good number for text-width

In unstyled HTML, text runs the full width of the screen. For desktop users, that makes it difficult to track from the end of one line to the beginning of another. So let's make the lines shorter.

The ideal line length is 50-75 characters (or 2-3 alphabets ðŸ˜‰).

Much longer, and it's hard to move your eye from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. Much shorter, and the text feels like an unimportant sidebar.

## Left align ALWAYS

If it's >3 lines of text, it's left-align

Body text is always left-aligned. Hyphenation is not used at line endings. And links are underlined and/or highlighted with bold or color, sometimes only on hover.

DON'T MIX ALIGNMENT (if it's centered, then center all)

## 2 is magic

2 diffrent font-size, use font-weight and subtle color changes to create hierachy.

## Characters per line

The optimal number of characters per line is between 55 and 75, but 75 to 90 is more popular.
