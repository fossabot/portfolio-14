## What is this?

This is Khoa's personal portfolio+blog. Built using SvelteKit.

Current URL: [wentallout.tech](https://wentallout.tech)

## What makes this special?

It's just incredibly fast compared to other framework-based websites and has great SEO out-of-the-box. You won't need a backend or CMS though, the blog posts are just markdown files you can store on your computer. Imported images are converted to webp to optimize loading speed.
