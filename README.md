## ❓ What is this?

This is a portfolio/blog built using SvelteKit. Hosted on Netlify.

My portfolio URL: [wentallout.tech](https://wentallout.tech)

## 🤩 What makes this special?

A website made with SvelteKit is just incredibly fast even compared to other framework-based websites like React/Next/Vue and has great SEO out-of-the-box. You won't need a backend or CMS though, the blog posts are just markdown files you can store on your computer (see `routes/blog`).

All imported images are automatically converted to `webp` and lazy loaded to optimize loading speed.

Visitors can also comment on your blogs using GitHub discussion (you might want to customize `Comments.svelte` component so that it works on your repo)
