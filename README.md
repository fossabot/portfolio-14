## 🤩 What makes this special?

It's incredibly fast compared to other framework-based websites and has great SEO out-of-the-box. You won't need a backend or CMS though, the blog posts are just markdown files you can store on your computer. All imported images are converted to `webp` to optimize loading speed.
